# compiler-visualizer
An application that shows what happens when a program is compiled. I created this project because I found what I learned in my Compilers class very informative and wanted to build on the work I did and create a learning tool to teach others.

# Setup
To run this program, simply compile the source file CompilerVisualizer.java with the classpath including the deps folder. Then run the CompilerVisualizer class, again making sure the classpath includes the deps folder. All the instructions are written in the application.

# Credits
This application was built with Netbeans and the abego TreeLayout algorithm.
